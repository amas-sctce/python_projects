### Dailt Coding Problems

# Edit Distance

The edit distance between two strings refers to the minimum number of character insertions, substituitions and deletions required to change one string to the other. 

> For Example
> 
>
>> `Input : initial  = "kitten" `
>> `        final = "sitting"`
>>  `Output : 3`
>
> Output is 3 because 
> subtitute the "k" for "s"
> subtitute the "e" for "i"
> and append "g"
