# Subset Sum

Given a list of integers S and a target k. Write a function that return a Subset of S that adds upto k. If such a subset cannot be formed then return a null.

Integers can appear more than once in the list. You may assume that there is no negative numver in the list

> For Example
>
>> `input :`
>> `S = [12,1,61,5,9,2] ` 
>> ` k = 24 `
>
>> ` output : `
>> [12,1,9,2]
>
