# Create a Palindrome

Given a string, find the palindrome that can be made by inserting the fewest number of charactors as possible anywhere in the wor. If there are more than one palindrom of minimum length that can be made, return the lexicorgraphically earliest one (the fisrt one alphabatically).

>For Example
>
>>Given the string "race", you should return "ecarace", since we can add three letters to it (which is the smallest >>amount to make a palindrome). There are seven other palindromes that can be made from "race" by adding three >>letters, but "ecarace" comes first alphabetically.
>
>>Given the string "google", you should return "elgoogle"
